"""Centralised keyboard scan code definitions and helpers.

This module exposes the mapping between human readable key names and the
corresponding Windows scan codes used by the project.  Keeping the mapping in
a dedicated module allows other parts of the codebase (for example the
``agent`` runtime and the ``recorder`` utilities) to share a single source of
truth for key identifiers.
